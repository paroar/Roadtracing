# Roadtracing

Roadtracing is a project that stores coordinates to track and identify dangerous accelerations.

&nbsp;

## Composition

The project is composed of a mobile app, a queue and a database.

### Mobile App

The [mobile-app] sends data to the queue via websockets.

### Queue

In case the database is down, Apache Kafka allow us to buffer the data until the database is up and running again.

For this to work we need a producer and a consumer.

The [producer] receives data via websocket and sends it to kafka.

The [consumer] consumes data from kafka and inserts it into a databse.

### Database

Mongodb, an easy to use database.

&nbsp;

## Usage

The provided docker-compose file is a basic configuration of roadtracing. We can configure kafka to have more partitions and brokers.

Run containers.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Stop containers.

```sh
docker-compose stop
```

Remove containers.

```sh
docker-compose down
```
